# Interpreter-Creation-for-a-Grammar-Using-ANTLR-and-NetBeans
This project implements an interpreter for a custom language defined by a grammar using **ANTLR** and **NetBeans**. The grammar is specified in the `project.g4` file. When processed by ANTLR, this file generates the necessary parser classes, with the exception of two main classes: `Main` and `MyVisitor`.

- **Main Class**: Handles the graphical user interface (GUI) and interacts with the `MyVisitor` class to process the grammar and interpret the program.
- **MyVisitor Class**: Extends `ProjectBaseVisitor` (generated by ANTLR) where various methods are overridden to define specific actions for each grammar element.

## Features

- **ANTLR Grammar Parsing**: The `project.g4` file defines the custom grammar, which is parsed and interpreted by the generated classes.
- **Visitor Pattern**: Implements the visitor pattern to handle various grammar rules via the `MyVisitor` class.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Uses a `HashMap` to store identifiers and their values during execution.
- **Program Execution**: Includes functionality to process functions, `for` loops, and more, based on the defined grammar.

## Requirements

- **NetBeans IDE**: To run the project and edit the code.
- **ANTLR**: To generate the parser and lexer files from the `project.g4` grammar.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
    cd project-name
    ```

2. **Open the project in NetBeans**:
   - Import the project into NetBeans IDE to work on the code.

3. **Generate Parser Files**:
   - Use ANTLR to generate the parser and lexer files from the `project.g4` file.

4. **Implement the Visitor**:
   - In `MyVisitor`, override methods for different grammar rules (such as `visitProgram`, `visitFunction_definition`, `visitFor`, etc.).

5. **Run the Project**:
   - Use the `Main` class to execute the interpreter and view the results in the GUI.

## Code Overview

### MyVisitor Class

The `MyVisitor` class is responsible for processing different grammar rules using the visitor pattern. Key methods include:

- **`getResult()`**: Returns the final result of the program's execution after all grammar rules are processed.
  
- **`visitProgram()`**: Handles the parsing of the program as a whole, checking the structure of the input code.
  
- **`visitFunction_definitions()` and `visitFunction_definition()`**: These methods are responsible for detecting and processing function definitions, and they define how functions are parsed and executed.
  
- **`visitFor()`**: This method detects `for` loops in the input code. When a `for` statement is encountered:
  - The `identifier` is retrieved from `ctx.identifier` and stored as the key in the memory data structure (HashMap).
  - The corresponding `number` (from `ctx.number`) is stored as the value associated with the identifier.
  - The loop condition is checked, and the value is converted to an integer for comparison.
  - The loop continues until the condition is no longer true.

### Data Structures

- **String Variable**: Used to store the programâ€™s output (as a string).
  
- **HashMap**: Stores variables (identifiers) and their corresponding values dynamically during execution, allowing the interpreter to manage variable states.

## Example Usage

```java
// Example input for the interpreter (pseudocode)
program = "for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) { print(i); }"

// The interpreter detects:
- A `for` loop with identifier `i`
- The starting value for `i` (0) is stored in memory
- The loop condition (`i < 10`) is evaluated
- The value of `i` is incremented and stored in memory during each iteration
